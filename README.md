# sendit

sendit is a small app I built to automatically text myself photos from my laptop.
I meant to expand this app to other friends and family who wanted a faster way than
email to send photos between their devices. However, I realized that using the free tier
of the twilio api disallowed me from programmatically adding accounts I could text.
Additionally,
I had a very low limit of media messages I could send before having to drop more money.
